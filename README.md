## Two Learning Tracks

### Express Track (Recommended)
**Time:** 75-90 minutes total
**Files:** A-files only (one per week)
**Format:** Streamlined lessons emphasizing core concepts and AI-assisted workflows
**Outcome:** Operationally confident, ready to use developer tools in daily work
**Philosophy:** Learn fundamentals, use AI for syntax and commands

**Why start here:** Get functional fast, then return to Comprehensive lessons only when you need deeper understanding of specific topics.

### Comprehensive Track (Optional Deep Dive)
**Time:** 8-13 hours over 6 weeks
**Files:** C-files (detailed instructions)
**Format:** Extensive lessons with practice exercises and troubleshooting
**Outcome:** Strong foundational knowledge, portfolio-ready skills
**When to use:** When you want thorough understanding, are training others, need to troubleshoot issues, or prefer comprehensive learning

**Both tracks teach the same skills** - Express gets you operational quickly, Comprehensive provides depth. You can mix and match: do Express for most weeks, Comprehensive for topics that interest you.

## Who This Is For

**UX professionals who need to:**
- Collaborate effectively with development teams using their tools and workflows
- Document decisions with version control
- Manage design system documentation alongside developers
- Bridge the gap between design and engineering

**No programming experience required.** This curriculum teaches you to understand and use developer workflows for UX work. You're learning to meet developers where they are, using the tools and processes they rely on daily.

---

## Prerequisites

- Mac computer (commands are Mac-specific)
- 45-60 minutes for initial setup (one-time)
- Willingness to use command line tools
- A UX project to document (or use provided examples)

---

## What You'll Build

By Week 6, you'll have:
- Complete UX project repository on GitHub
- Professional documentation structure
- Working knowledge of Git workflows
- Collaboration skills matching development teams

---

## How It Works

**Each week includes:**
1. **Express track (A-files)** - Streamlined lessons emphasizing core concepts (~10-30 min)
2. **Prerequisites check (B-files)** - Verify you're ready to start
3. **Comprehensive instructions (C-files)** - Detailed step-by-step lessons (1-3 hours)
4. **Practice exercises (D & E-files)** - Hands-on activities and templates
5. **Solution files (F-files)** - Reference for expected outcomes

**File naming convention:**
- `A-weekX-express.md` - Express track version (~10-30 min per week) - PRIMARY LEARNING PATH
- `B-weekX-prerequisites-check.md` - Setup verification
- `C-weekX-instructions.md` - Comprehensive lesson (1-3 hours)
- `D-weekX-practice-*.md` - Practice exercises
- `E-weekX-practice-*.md` - Additional exercises or templates
- `F-weekX-solution-*.md` - Expected outcomes and reference solutions

**Reference materials:**
- `docs/` folder contains templates and supplementary materials (e.g., PR template)

**Learning approach:** Start with Express track (A-files) to quickly become operational with developer tools. Return to Comprehensive track (C-files) when you need deeper understanding or want to master specific topics.

## Time Commitment

**Express Track (A-files):**
- Week 1-6: 75-90 minutes total
- Focus on core concepts and AI-assisted workflows
- Return to comprehensive lessons (C-files) as needed

**Comprehensive Track (C-files):**
- Week 1: 45-75 minutes (Terminal & Markdown basics)
- Week 2: 1-1.5 hours (VS Code setup)
- Week 3: 2-3 hours (Git fundamentals - conceptually hardest)
- Week 4: 1-1.5 hours (GitHub & remote repos)
- Week 5: 1.5-2.5 hours (Branching & collaboration)
- Week 6: 2-3 hours (Real project setup - varies by complexity)
- **Total: 8-13 hours**

---

## Getting Started

**Recommended path (Express Track):**
1. Start with `A-week1-express.md` - Jump right into the fast track
2. Complete weeks sequentially - each builds on previous skills (75-90 min total)
3. Return to `C-week*-instructions.md` files only when you need deeper understanding

**Alternative (Comprehensive Track):**
1. Start with `B-week1-prerequisites-check.md` for setup verification
2. Follow `C-week*-instructions.md` files for detailed lessons (8-13 hours total)
3. Practice daily (even 10 minutes helps)

**Both paths:**
- Complete weeks sequentially
- Use AI assistants when stuck (prompts provided in Week 6)

---

## Support

**When you get stuck:**
- Each lesson includes troubleshooting sections
- Comprehensive lessons (C-files) provide detailed explanations
- AI prompts for custom learning (especially in Week 6)
- Solution files (F-files) show expected outcomes
- Reference materials in docs/ folder

**Remember:** Everyone struggles with Git at first—including developers. Give it time. **This is career development—you're learning skills that make you more effective and employable.**

**Learning strategy:** Start with Express track (A-files) to build working knowledge quickly. When you encounter specific challenges or want comprehensive understanding, refer to the Comprehensive lessons (C-files). Focus on what's relevant to your current needs and return for additional depth as your work requires it.

---

## After Completion

**You'll be able to:**
- Understand and use the same version control tools as your development team
- Collaborate using branches and pull requests—the standard developer workflow
- Document research and design decisions in ways developers can easily review

**This makes you more valuable because:**
- You speak the developer's language for version control and collaboration
- You can contribute directly to repositories without requiring developer assistance
- You understand the constraints and workflows developers navigate daily

**Next steps:**
- Apply these skills to real projects immediately
- Share this knowledge with your UX team
- Participate in cross-functional initiatives with confidence

## Notes

- Commands are Mac-specific (Terminal, keyboard shortcuts)
- GitHub account required
- No programming knowledge needed
- Course focus is on UX workflows, not software development
