## Learning Paths

### Standard Track (Recommended)
**Time:** 8-13 hours over 6 weeks
**Format:** Focused hands-on exercises with essential concepts
**Outcome:** Working knowledge of developer workflows, portfolio-ready skills
**Philosophy:** Practical, focused content

### Express Track (Time-Constrained)
**Time:** 75-90 minutes total
**Format:** Bare minimum to be functional, AI-assisted learning prompts
**Outcome:** Operationally confident, return for depth when needed

### Explore Deeper (Optional)
**Time:** Additional 8-12 hours
**Format:** Advanced topics, edge cases, best practices
**Outcome:** Beginner to Intermediate
**When to use:** After completing standard track, when encountering specific challenges, or when you want comprehensive understanding

Each week includes standard, express, and optional exploration versions—choose based on your available time and learning goals.

## Who This Is For

**UX professionals who need to:**
- Collaborate effectively with development teams using their tools and workflows
- Document decisions with version control
- Manage design system documentation alongside developers
- Bridge the gap between design and engineering

**No programming experience required.** This curriculum teaches you to understand and use developer workflows for UX work. You're learning to meet developers where they are, using the tools and processes they rely on daily.

---

## Prerequisites

- Mac computer (commands are Mac-specific)
- 45-60 minutes for initial setup (one-time)
- Willingness to use command line tools
- A UX project to document (or use provided examples)

---

## What You'll Build

By Week 6, you'll have:
- Complete UX project repository on GitHub
- Professional documentation structure
- Working knowledge of Git workflows
- Collaboration skills matching development teams

---

## How It Works

**Each week includes:**
1. **Prerequisites check** - Verify you're ready to start
2. **Main instructions** - Step-by-step lesson with examples
3. **Practice exercises** - Streamlined, hands-on activities (just the essentials)
4. **Solution files** - Reference for expected outcomes
5. **Express version** - Fast track if time is limited
6. **Explore deeper** - Optional advanced content (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)

**File naming convention:**
- `00-weekX-express.md` - Fast track version (~10-20 min per week)
- `01-weekX-prerequisites-check.md` - Setup verification
- `02-weekX-instructions.md` - Main lesson
- `03-weekX-practice-*.md` - Practice files (streamlined for essential learning)
- `04-weekX-practice-*.md` - Additional exercises
- `05-weekX-solution-*.md` - Expected outcomes
- `06-weekX-explore-deeper.md` - Optional advanced topics (when applicable)

**Learning approach:** Practice files are streamlined to focus on essential concepts, with hands-on exercises to build practical skills. Once comfortable with the basics, optionally explore deeper topics for comprehensive understanding or when you encounter specific challenges.

## Time Commitment

**Standard Track (streamlined for efficiency):**
- Week 1: 45-75 minutes (Terminal & Markdown basics)
- Week 2: 1-1.5 hours (VS Code setup)
- Week 3: 2-3 hours (Git fundamentals - conceptually hardest)
- Week 4: 1-1.5 hours (GitHub & remote repos)
- Week 5: 1.5-2.5 hours (Branching & collaboration)
- Week 6: 2-3 hours (Real project setup - varies by complexity)
- **Total: 8-13 hours**

**Express Track:**
- All weeks combined: 75-90 minutes
- Return to standard lessons as needed

**Explore Deeper (optional):**
- Week 1: +1.5-2 hours (Advanced markdown, terminal commands)
- Week 2: +2-3 hours (VS Code mastery, productivity)
- Week 4: +2-3 hours (Remote Git deep dive, troubleshooting)
- Week 5: +2.5-4 hours (Advanced branching, PR workflows)
- **Total optional content: 8-12 additional hours**

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with `01-week1-prerequisites-check.md`
2. Or, if time is tight, try `00-week1-express.md`
3. Complete weeks sequentially—each builds on previous skills
4. Practice daily (even 10 minutes helps)
5. Use AI assistants when stuck (prompts provided)

---

## Support

**When you get stuck:**
- Each lesson includes troubleshooting sections
- Optional "Explore Deeper" files cover advanced scenarios (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)
- AI prompts for custom learning
- Solutions files show expected outcomes

**Remember:** Everyone struggles with Git at first—including developers. Give it time. **This is career development—you're learning skills that make you more effective and employable.**

**Learning strategy:** Start with standard track materials to build working knowledge. When you encounter specific challenges or want comprehensive understanding, consult the explore deeper files. Focus on what's relevant to your current needs and return for additional topics as your work requires them.

---

## After Completion

**You'll be able to:**
- Understand and use the same version control tools as your development team
- Collaborate using branches and pull requests—the standard developer workflow
- Document research and design decisions in ways developers can easily review

**This makes you more valuable because:**
- You speak the developer's language for version control and collaboration
- You can contribute directly to repositories without requiring developer assistance
- You understand the constraints and workflows developers navigate daily

**Next steps:**
- Apply these skills to real projects immediately
- Share this knowledge with your UX team
- Participate in cross-functional initiatives with confidence

## Notes

- Commands are Mac-specific (Terminal, keyboard shortcuts)
- GitHub account required
- No programming knowledge needed
- Course focus is on UX workflows, not software development
