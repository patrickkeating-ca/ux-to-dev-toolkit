- Working knowledge of Git workflows
- Collaboration skills matching development teams
- Portfolio piece demonstrating technical proficiency

---

## How It Works

**Each week includes:**
1. **Prerequisites check** - Verify you're ready to start
2. **Main instructions** - Step-by-step lesson with examples
3. **Practice exercises** - Streamlined, hands-on activities (just the essentials)
4. **Solution files** - Reference for expected outcomes
5. **Express version** - Fast track if time is limited
6. **Explore deeper** - Optional advanced content (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)

**File naming convention:**
- `00-weekX-express.md` - Fast track version (~10-20 min per week)
- `01-weekX-prerequisites-check.md` - Setup verification
- `02-weekX-instructions.md` - Main lesson
- `03-weekX-practice-*.md` - Practice files (streamlined for essential learning)
- `04-weekX-practice-*.md` - Additional exercises
- `05-weekX-solution-*.md` - Expected outcomes
- `06-weekX-explore-deeper.md` - Optional advanced topics (when applicable)

**Learning approach:** Practice files are streamlined to focus on essential concepts, with hands-on exercises to build practical skills. Once comfortable with the basics, optionally explore deeper topics for comprehensive understanding or when you encounter specific challenges.

## Time Commitment

**Standard Track (streamlined for efficiency):**
- Week 1: 45-75 minutes (Terminal & Markdown basics)
- Week 2: 1-1.5 hours (VS Code setup)
- Week 3: 2-3 hours (Git fundamentals - conceptually hardest)
- Week 4: 1-1.5 hours (GitHub & remote repos)
- Week 5: 1.5-2.5 hours (Branching & collaboration)
- Week 6: 2-3 hours (Real project setup - varies by complexity)
- **Total: 8-13 hours**

**Express Track:**
- All weeks combined: 75-90 minutes
- Return to standard lessons as needed

**Explore Deeper (optional):**
- Week 1: +1.5-2 hours (Advanced markdown, terminal commands)
- Week 2: +2-3 hours (VS Code mastery, productivity)
- Week 4: +2-3 hours (Remote Git deep dive, troubleshooting)
- Week 5: +2.5-4 hours (Advanced branching, PR workflows)
- **Total optional content: 8-12 additional hours**

## Comparison to Other Courses

**LinkedIn Learning Git courses:** 1-4 hours of video (developer-focused)
**This program (Standard Track):** 8-13 hours hands-on practice (UX-focused)
**This program (Express Track):** 75-90 minutes (functional basics)
**This program (with Explore Deeper):** 16-25 hours (mastery)

**The difference:** Developer courses teach Git for code management. This program teaches Git from a UX perspective—for documentation, research repositories, and design collaboration. You'll learn the same professional tools developers use, applied to your actual UX work.

**The approach:** Streamlined, practical content focused on what UX professionals need to know. Core concepts are presented clearly and applied through hands-on exercises. Advanced topics and edge cases are available in optional "Explore Deeper" sections when you need them.

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with `01-week1-prerequisites-check.md`
2. Or, if time is tight, try `00-week1-express.md`
3. Complete weeks sequentially—each builds on previous skills
4. Practice daily (even 10 minutes helps)
5. Use AI assistants when stuck (prompts provided)

---

## Support

**When you get stuck:**
- Each lesson includes troubleshooting sections
- Optional "Explore Deeper" files cover advanced scenarios (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)
- AI prompts for custom learning
- Solutions files show expected outcomes
- Google is your friend (developers use it constantly)

**Remember:** Everyone struggles with Git at first—including developers. The concepts are unfamiliar but they're powerful. Give it time. **This is career development—you're learning skills that make you more effective and employable.**

**Learning strategy:** Start with standard track materials to build working knowledge. When you encounter specific challenges or want comprehensive understanding, consult the explore deeper files. Focus on what's relevant to your current needs and return for additional topics as your work requires them.

---

## After Completion

**You'll be able to:**
- Understand and use the same version control tools as your development team
- Collaborate using branches and pull requests—the standard developer workflow
- Document research and design decisions in ways developers can easily review
- Communicate more effectively with engineering teams
- Contribute to design system repositories and collaborative projects
- Demonstrate technical proficiency that enhances your employability

**This makes you more valuable because:**
- You speak the developer's language for version control and collaboration
- You can contribute directly to repositories without requiring developer assistance
- You understand the constraints and workflows developers navigate daily
- You bridge the gap between design and engineering more effectively

**Next steps:**
- Apply these skills to real projects immediately
- Share this knowledge with your UX team
- Contribute to design system repositories
- Participate in cross-functional initiatives with confidence
- Continue learning from developers—you now have common ground
