## Learning Paths

### Standard Track (Recommended)
**Time:** 8-13 hours over 6 weeks
**Format:** Focused hands-on exercises with essential concepts
**Outcome:** Deep understanding and portfolio-ready skills
**Philosophy:** Learn by doing—get the flavor without the overwhelm

### Express Track (Time-Constrained)
**Time:** 75-90 minutes total
**Format:** Bare minimum to be functional, AI-assisted learning prompts
**Outcome:** Operational quickly, return for depth when needed

### Explore Deeper (Optional)
**Time:** Additional 8-12 hours
**Format:** Advanced topics, edge cases, best practices
**Outcome:** Mastery-level knowledge
**When to use:** After completing standard track, when encountering specific challenges, or when you want comprehensive understanding

Each week includes standard, express, and optional exploration versions—choose based on your available time and learning goals.

## Who This Is For

- UXers wanting to collaborate better with developers
- UXers documenting findings in version control
- Product designers managing design systems
- Anyone in UX who needs to bridge the gap to development teams

**No programming experience required.** This course focuses on documentation, research, and design workflows—not code.

---

## Prerequisites

- Mac computer (commands are Mac-specific)
- 45-60 minutes for initial setup (one-time)
- Willingness to use command line tools
- A UX project to document (or use provided examples)

---

## What You'll Build

By Week 6, you'll have:
- Complete UX project repository on GitHub
- Professional documentation structure
- Working knowledge of Git workflows
- Collaboration skills matching development teams
- Portfolio piece demonstrating technical proficiency

---

## How It Works

**Each week includes:**
1. **Prerequisites check** - Verify you're ready to start
2. **Main instructions** - Step-by-step lesson with examples
3. **Practice exercises** - Streamlined, hands-on activities (just the essentials)
4. **Solution files** - Reference for expected outcomes
5. **Express version** - Fast track if time is limited
6. **Explore deeper** - Optional advanced content (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)

**File naming convention:**
- `00-weekX-express.md` - Fast track version (~10-20 min per week)
- `01-weekX-prerequisites-check.md` - Setup verification
- `02-weekX-instructions.md` - Main lesson
- `03-weekX-practice-*.md` - Practice files (streamlined for essential learning)
- `04-weekX-practice-*.md` - Additional exercises
- `05-weekX-solution-*.md` - Expected outcomes
- `06-weekX-explore-deeper.md` - Optional advanced topics (when applicable)

**Learning approach:** Practice files focus on building confidence through hands-on experience. Once comfortable with the basics, optionally explore deeper topics when needed.

## Time Commitment

**Standard Track (streamlined for efficiency):**
- Week 1: 45-75 minutes (Terminal & Markdown basics)
- Week 2: 1-1.5 hours (VS Code setup)
- Week 3: 2-3 hours (Git fundamentals - conceptually hardest)
- Week 4: 1-1.5 hours (GitHub & remote repos)
- Week 5: 1.5-2.5 hours (Branching & collaboration)
- Week 6: 2-3 hours (Real project setup - varies by complexity)
- **Total: 8-13 hours**

**Express Track:**
- All weeks combined: 75-90 minutes
- Return to standard lessons as needed

**Explore Deeper (optional):**
- Week 1: +1.5-2 hours (Advanced markdown, terminal commands)
- Week 2: +2-3 hours (VS Code mastery, productivity)
- Week 4: +2-3 hours (Remote Git deep dive, troubleshooting)
- Week 5: +2.5-4 hours (Advanced branching, PR workflows)
- **Total optional content: 8-12 additional hours**

## Comparison to Other Courses

**LinkedIn Learning Git courses:** 1-4 hours of video (developer-focused)
**This program (Standard Track):** 8-13 hours hands-on practice (UX-focused)
**This program (Express Track):** 75-90 minutes (functional basics)
**This program (with Explore Deeper):** 16-25 hours (mastery)

**The difference:** Developer courses teach Git for code management. This program teaches Git for UX documentation, research repositories, and design collaboration. You'll apply the same professional tools to your actual work.

**The philosophy:** Give you the flavor and confidence through focused practice. See the "aha!" moments (like VS Code showing markdown changes in real-time) without overwhelming detail. Advanced topics available when you need them.

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with `01-week1-prerequisites-check.md`
2. Or, if time is tight, try `00-week1-express.md`
3. Complete weeks sequentially—each builds on previous skills
4. Practice daily (even 10 minutes helps)
5. Use AI assistants when stuck (prompts provided)

---

## Support

**When you get stuck:**
- Each lesson includes troubleshooting sections
- Optional "Explore Deeper" files cover advanced scenarios (Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5)
- AI prompts for custom learning
- Solutions files show expected outcomes
- Google is your friend (developers use it constantly)

**Remember:** Everyone struggles with Git at first. The concepts are foreign but they're powerful. Give it time. **Think of it as on-the-job training**.

**Learning strategy:** Start with standard track practice files to build confidence. When you encounter specific challenges or want deeper understanding, consult the explore deeper files. You don't need to read everything—learn what you need, when you need it.

---

## After Completion

**You'll be able to:**
- Set up professional UX project repositories
- Collaborate using branches and pull requests
- Document research and design decisions with version control
- Work effectively alongside development teams
- Contribute to open source UX projects
- Show technical proficiency on your resume **AND** as part of your year-end review

**Next steps:**
- Apply these skills to real projects
- Teach teammates the workflow
- Contribute to design system repositories
- Join collaborative UX initiatives
- Talk with a developer; learn from them
