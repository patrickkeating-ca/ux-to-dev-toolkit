## Learning Paths

### Standard Track (Recommended)
**Time:** 15-20 hours over 6 weeks  
**Format:** Comprehensive lessons with daily practice exercises  
**Outcome:** Deep understanding and portfolio-ready skills

### Express Track (Time-Constrained)
**Time:** 75-90 minutes total  
**Format:** Bare minimum to be functional, AI-assisted learning prompts  
**Outcome:** Operational quickly, return for depth when needed

Each week includes both standard and express versions—choose based on your available time.

## Who This Is For

- UXers wanting to collaborate better with developers
- UXers documenting findings in version control
- Product designers managing design systems
- Anyone in UX who needs to bridge the gap to development teams

**No programming experience required.** This course focuses on documentation, research, and design workflows—not code.

---

## Prerequisites

- Mac computer (commands are Mac-specific)
- 45-60 minutes for initial setup (one-time)
- Willingness to use command line tools
- A UX project to document (or use provided examples)

---

## What You'll Build

By Week 6, you'll have:
- Complete UX project repository on GitHub
- Professional documentation structure
- Working knowledge of Git workflows
- Collaboration skills matching development teams
- Portfolio piece demonstrating technical proficiency

---

## How It Works

**Each week includes:**
1. **Prerequisites check** - Verify you're ready to start
2. **Main instructions** - Step-by-step lesson with examples
3. **Practice exercises** - Hands-on activities
4. **Solution files** - Reference for expected outcomes
5. **Express version** - Fast track if time is limited

**File naming convention:**
- `00-weekX-express.md` - Fast track version
- `01-weekX-prerequisites-check.md` - Setup verification
- `02-weekX-instructions.md` - Main lesson
- `03-weekX-practice-*.md` - Practice files
- `04-weekX-practice-*.md` - Additional exercises
- `05-weekX-solution-*.md` - Expected outcomes

---

## Time Commitment

**Standard Track:**
- Week 1: 1-2 hours
- Week 2: 1.5-2 hours
- Week 3: 2.5-3.5 hours (conceptually hardest)
- Week 4: 2-3 hours
- Week 5: 2.5-3.5 hours
- Week 6: 2-4 hours (varies by project complexity)

**Express Track:**
- All weeks combined: 75-90 minutes
- Return to standard lessons as needed

---

## Comparison to Other Courses

**LinkedIn Learning Git courses:** 1-4 hours of video content (developer-focused)  
**This program:** 15-20 hours with hands-on practice (UX-focused)

The difference: Developer courses teach Git for code management. This program teaches Git for UX documentation, research repositories, and design and prototype collaboration. You'll apply the same professional tools to your actual work.

---

## Getting Started

1. Start with `01-week1-prerequisites-check.md`
2. Or, if time is tight, try `00-week1-express.md`
3. Complete weeks sequentially—each builds on previous skills
4. Practice daily (even 10 minutes helps)
5. Use AI assistants when stuck (prompts provided)

---

## Support

**When you get stuck:**
- Each lesson includes troubleshooting sections
- AI prompts for custom learning
- Solutions files show expected outcomes
- Google is your friend (developers use it constantly)

**Remember:** Everyone struggles with Git at first. The concepts are foreign but they're powerful. Give it time. **Think of it as on-the-job training**.

---

## After Completion

**You'll be able to:**
- Set up professional UX project repositories
- Collaborate using branches and pull requests
- Document research and design decisions with version control
- Work effectively alongside development teams
- Contribute to open source UX projects
- Show technical proficiency on your resume **AND** as part of your year-end review

**Next steps:**
- Apply these skills to real projects
- Teach teammates the workflow
- Contribute to design system repositories
- Join collaborative UX initiatives
- Talk with a developer; learn from them

---

## Program Structure

**Weeks 1-4: Foundations**
Master the tools and core workflows. Can be taken as standalone "Git & GitHub Foundations for UX" course.

**Weeks 5-6: Applied Practice**
Professional collaboration and real project setup. Can be taken as standalone "Collaborative UX Documentation with Git" course (requires Weeks 1-4 or equivalent knowledge).
