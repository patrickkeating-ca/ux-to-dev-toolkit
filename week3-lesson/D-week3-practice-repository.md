# Git Practice Repository

## Purpose

This file exists to practice Git operations. You'll track changes to this file as you learn Git basics.

---

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. Instead of creating multiple copies of files (like final_v1.md, final_v2.md), Git maintains one file and remembers every version.

---

## Why Use Git?

**Benefits of version control:**
- Track every change made to files
- See who changed what and when
- Revert to previous versions if needed
- Collaborate without overwriting each other's work
- Keep a complete history of your project

---

## Basic Git Workflow

The standard workflow involves three steps:

1. Make changes to files
2. Stage the changes you want to commit
3. Commit the staged changes with a descriptive message

This pattern repeats throughout your project.

## Experiments

Try making changes to this file and tracking them with Git:

**Experiment 1:** Add a new section below
**Experiment 2:** Modify an existing section
**Experiment 3:** Delete some text

After each experiment, use git status, git diff, and git log to see what Git tracked.

## My First Commit

This file was part of my first commit! The commit message was probably something like "Initial commit - added practice files."

---

## My Second Commit

[Edit this file and commit again - add notes about what you learned]

---

## My Third Commit

[Make more changes and commit them]

---

## Conclusion

By the time you finish Week 3, this file will have multiple commits showing your Git learning journey. Use git log to see the complete history.
