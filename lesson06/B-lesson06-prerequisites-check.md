## The Big Picture

### What Lesson 6 Accomplishes

**Weeks 1-5 taught individual skills.**

**Lesson 6 combines them into a complete system:**

```
Your UX Project Repository
├── Git version control (Lesson 3)
├── Synced to GitHub (Lesson 4)
├── Branch workflow (Lesson 5)
├── Team collaboration (Lesson 5)
├── Professional structure (Lesson 1 learning)
└── All documentation in markdown (Lesson 1)
```

**After Lesson 6, you'll have a template for all future projects.**

---

## Files You Need

For this lesson, you'll use:

1. The repository structure template from earlier lessons
2. `[A-F]-lesson06-practice-setup.md` - Setup checklist
3. `[A-F]-lesson06-practice-collaboration-guide.md` - Team guidelines
4. `[A-F]-lesson06-solution-complete-repo.md` - Final repository example

**Download these to a new folder:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir lesson06-final-project
cd lesson06-final-project
```

---

## What Makes This Different

### Previous Weeks vs. Lesson 6

**Weeks 1-5:**
- Practice exercises
- Isolated skills
- Temporary repositories
- Learning fundamentals

**Lesson 6:**
- Real project setup
- Combined skills
- Production repository
- Actual work template

**Lesson 6 is the transition from learning to doing.**

---

## Project Scope

### What You'll Build

**A complete UX project repository with:**
- README explaining the project
- PLATFORM.md with technical details
- docs/ folder with all documentation
- Proper .gitignore
- Branch protection (optional)
- Collaboration guidelines
- Decision log
- PRD template

**This becomes your template for future projects.**

---

## Collaboration Component

### Working with Others (Optional)

**If you have a teammate available:**
- Invite them to your repository
- Practice collaborative workflow
- Review each other's PRs
- Experience real collaboration

**If working solo:**
- Still valuable to set up
- Practice as if team exists
- Ready when teammates join

**Lesson 6 works either way.**

---

## Common Concerns

**"What if I make a mistake?"**
- This is a practice repository
- You can delete and start over
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Nothing is permanently broken

**"Do I need a real UX project?"**
- No, you can use a hypothetical project
- Lesson 6 teaches setup, not the UX work itself
- Focus on structure and process

**"How long before I'm ready for real work?"**
- After Lesson 6, you have the foundation
- Apply to actual projects immediately
- Proficiency comes with daily use
- Give yourself 2-3 real projects to feel fully comfortable

**"What if my team doesn't use Git?"**
- You can still use it for personal organization
- Version control helps even solo
- May influence team to adopt it
- Skills transfer to any version control system
