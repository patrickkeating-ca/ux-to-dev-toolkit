## Tips for Learning Shortcuts

**When you forget:**
- Command + Shift + P shows all commands with their shortcuts
- Hover over buttons to see shortcuts
- Look them up - that's normal

**Build habits:**
- Force yourself to use shortcuts even when slower at first
- In 2 weeks, they'll be faster than mouse
- Use Command Palette as training wheels

**Customize if needed:**
- Code → Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts
- Search for action
- Change shortcut to your preference

---

## Completion Check

Count how many boxes you checked:

- **15-20 boxes:** Excellent! You tried everything
- **10-14 boxes:** Great! You got the important ones
- **5-9 boxes:** Good start! Come back and try more
- **0-4 boxes:** Go back and actually try the shortcuts

**Remember:** You learn by doing, not reading.

## What's Most Important

**Use these daily:**
- Command + P (open file)
- Command + S (save)

Master those four first. Add others gradually.
