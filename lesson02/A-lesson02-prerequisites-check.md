# Prerequisites Check - Lesson 2
## VS Code Setup & Workflow

### Before Starting This Lesson

Verify you completed Lesson 1 and have the required setup.

---

## Lesson 1 Completion Check

You should have already:

- [ ] Completed Lesson 1 exercises
- [ ] Used Terminal commands (pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch)
- [ ] Fixed the broken markdown file
- [ ] Opened a folder in VS Code using `code .`
- [ ] Previewed markdown in VS Code

**If you haven't done Lesson 1:** Go back and complete it first. Lesson 2 builds on those skills.

---

## Required Setup

### 1. VS Code is Installed and Working

**Verify:**
```bash
code --version
```

**Expected:** You see version information

**If not working:** Review Lesson 1 prerequisites check for installation steps

---

### 2. Terminal Commands are Comfortable

**Quick test:**
```bash
# Can you navigate to Desktop?
cd ~/Desktop

# Can you see where you are?
pwd

# Can you list files?
ls
```

**If these feel unfamiliar:** Practice Lesson 1's navigation exercise again before continuing.

---

### 3. Practice Folder Exists

**From Lesson 1, you should have created practice files.**

**Check:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
ls
```

Do you see a folder you created in Lesson 1? (like `lesson01-practice` or `terminal-practice`)

**If not:** That's okay, we'll create a new one for Lesson 2.

---

## New for Lesson 2

### Create Lesson 2 Practice Folder

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir lesson02-practice
cd lesson02-practice
```

**Verify:**
```bash
pwd
```

You should see: `/Users/YourName/Desktop/lesson02-practice`
