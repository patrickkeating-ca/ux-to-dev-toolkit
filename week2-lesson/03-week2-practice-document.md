UX Research Findings - Mobile App Navigation Study

Executive Summary
Our research shows that users struggle with the current navigation structure. We recommend a simplified approach based on user mental models.

Research Methodology

We conducted the following research activities:
Interviews with 12 participants
Usability testing with 8 users
Card sorting exercise with 15 participants
Analytics review of 30 days of user behavior

Key Findings

Finding 1 Navigation Confusion
Users could not find key features within the app. The average time to locate account settings was 45 seconds, well above our 10 second target.

Most users expected account settings to be in:
Top right menu
Profile section
Main navigation

Finding 2 Search Functionality
80% of users attempted to use search when they couldn't find what they needed. However, our search feature is hidden in a submenu.

Quote from Participant 7
"I just want to search for what I need. Why is that so hard to find?"

Finding 3 Menu Structure
The current three-tier menu structure is too deep. Users abandon tasks when they have to click more than twice to reach their goal.

Task completion rates:
1 click away: 95%
2 clicks away: 78%
3 clicks away: 42%

Recommendations

Based on our findings, we propose the following changes:

Flatten the navigation hierarchy to maximum 2 levels
Add persistent search bar to top of app
Move account settings to profile tab
Consolidate related features into logical groups

Implementation Priority

High Priority
Add search bar to main screen
Relocate account settings

Medium Priority
Restructure main navigation
Update visual hierarchy

Low Priority
Redesign menu icons
Add onboarding tutorial
