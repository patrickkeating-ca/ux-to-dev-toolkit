# Mobile App Navigation Study

## Executive Summary

Users struggle with current navigation. We recommend a simplified approach.

---

## Research Methods

We conducted:
- 12 user interviews
- 8 usability tests
- Card sorting with 15 participants

---

## Key Finding: Navigation Confusion

Users couldn't find key features. Average time to locate settings: **45 seconds** (target: 10 seconds).

**Quote from Participant 7:**
> "I just want to search for what I need. Why is that so hard to find?"

**Task Completion Rates:**
- 1 click away: 95%
- 2 clicks away: 78%
- 3 clicks away: 42%

---

## Recommendations

We propose these changes:

1. Flatten navigation to maximum 2 levels
2. Add persistent search bar
3. Move settings to profile tab
