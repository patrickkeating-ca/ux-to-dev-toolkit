# Prerequisites Check - Week 2
## VS Code Setup & Workflow

### Before Starting This Lesson

Verify you completed Week 1 and have the required setup.

---

## Week 1 Completion Check

You should have already:

- [ ] Completed Week 1 exercises
- [ ] Used Terminal commands (pwd, ls, cd, mkdir, touch)
- [ ] Fixed the broken markdown file
- [ ] Opened a folder in VS Code using `code .`
- [ ] Previewed markdown in VS Code

**If you haven't done Week 1:** Go back and complete it first. Week 2 builds on those skills.

---

## Required Setup

### 1. VS Code is Installed and Working

**Verify:**
```bash
code --version
```

**Expected:** You see version information

**If not working:** Review Week 1 prerequisites check for installation steps

---

### 2. Terminal Commands are Comfortable

**Quick test:**
```bash
# Can you navigate to Desktop?
cd ~/Desktop

# Can you see where you are?
pwd

# Can you list files?
ls
```

**If these feel unfamiliar:** Practice Week 1's navigation exercise again before continuing.

---

### 3. Practice Folder Exists

**From Week 1, you should have created practice files.**

**Check:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
ls
```

Do you see a folder you created in Week 1? (like `week1-practice` or `terminal-practice`)

**If not:** That's okay, we'll create a new one for Week 2.

---

## New for Week 2

### Create Week 2 Practice Folder

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir week2-practice
cd week2-practice
```

**Verify:**
```bash
pwd
```

You should see: `/Users/YourName/Desktop/week2-practice`

## If You're Not Ready

**Week 1 still feels hard:**
- That's normal - spend another few days practicing
- Do the terminal navigation exercise again
- Create and edit a few more markdown files
- Come back to Week 2 when Week 1 feels natural

**Missing tools:**
- Review Week 1 prerequisites check
- Make sure VS Code and Terminal both work
- Get help from team channel if stuck

**Not sure you're ready:**
- If you can open Terminal, navigate to a folder, and open VS Code without looking at notes, you're ready
