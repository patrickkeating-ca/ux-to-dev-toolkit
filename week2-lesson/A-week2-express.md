# Week 2 Express: VS Code Setup & Workflow
## 10-Minute Quick Start

Skip the full lesson if you're short on time. Here's the bare minimum.

---

## Goal

Get VS Code working with just enough features to complete the course. Deep dive later.

**Time commitment:** 10-15 minutes

---

## Part 1: Install VS Code (3 minutes)

**If not already installed:**
1. Go to [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com)
2. Download for Mac
3. Drag to Applications folder
4. Open it

**Verify it works from Terminal:**
```bash
code --version
```

If that fails, open VS Code → Command + Shift + P → type "shell command" → Install 'code' command

---

## Part 2: Install Only These 2 Extensions (3 minutes)

**Click Extensions icon** (left sidebar, looks like blocks) or press Command + Shift + X

**Install:**
1. **Markdown Preview Enhanced** (by Yiyi Wang)
   - Why: Preview markdown files as you write
   
2. **GitLens** (by GitKraken)
   - Why: See Git info inline (useful from Week 3 onward)

**That's it. Skip the other extensions for now.**

Practice each one once:

**1. Command + P** - Quick open file

- Type filename, press Enter
- Fastest way to navigate

**2. Command + S** - Save file
- You'll use this constantly
- Make it muscle memory

**3. Control + `** - Toggle terminal
- Opens/closes terminal inside VS Code
- Backtick key (left of 1)

**4. Command + Shift + V** - Preview markdown
- Shows formatted view
- Essential for markdown work

**5. Command + B** - Toggle sidebar

- Gives you more screen space

**Practice these 5 until they feel natural. Ignore all others for now.**

## Part 4: Change One Setting (2 minutes)

**Enable Auto Save:**
1. Press Command + , (Command + comma)
2. Search: "auto save"
3. Change to: "afterDelay"
